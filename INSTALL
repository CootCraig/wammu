Wammu installation
==================

It uses standard distutils, so:
python setup.py build
su
python setup.py install

You need python-gammu installed to run and install this program. If you
want support for scanning bluetooth devices, you need btctl (part of GNOME
Bluetooth) or PyBluez.

If you want to obey dependency checking at build time for any reason,
you can use --skip-deps option.
