Wammu installation
==================

It uses standard distutils, so:
python setup.py build
su
python setup.py install

You need python-gammu and wxPython [1] (Unicode enabled build) installed to
run and install this program. If you want support for scanning bluetooth
devices, you need PyBluez [2]. For incoming events notifications, you
need dbus-pyhon [3].

For Windows you also have to install Pywin32 [4].

If you want to obey dependency checking at build time for any reason,
you can use --skip-deps option.

Cross compilation for Windows on Linux
======================================

You need Wine with installed all dependencies (see above section where
to get them).

Building installer for wammu for Python is easy:

wine c:\\python25\\python setup.py build --skip-deps bdist_wininst

However this way user needs to also install all dependencies, what is
really not comfortable. This should be solved using py2exe[5], but it
does not seem to work in Wine now:

wine c:\\python25\\python setup.py build --skip-deps py2exe

To start Wammu in local directory using wine just start:

wine c:\\python25\\python wammu.py

You can also use InnoSetup[6] to build installer for Wammu:

wine c:\\Program\ Files\\Inno\ Setup\ 5/\\ISCC.exe wammu.iss
