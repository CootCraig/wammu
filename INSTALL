Wammu installation
==================

It uses standard distutils, so:
python setup.py build
su
python setup.py install

You need python-gammu installed to run and install this program. If you
want support for scanning bluetooth devices, you need PyBluez [1].

For Windows you might want to install also Pywin32 [2], which allows to
show only installed devices.

If you want to obey dependency checking at build time for any reason,
you can use --skip-deps option.
