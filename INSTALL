Wammu installation
==================

It uses standard distutils, so:
python setup.py build
su
python setup.py install

You need python-gammu and wxPython (Unicode enabled build) installed to
run and install this program. If you want support for scanning bluetooth
devices, you need PyBluez [1].

For Windows you also have install Pywin32 [2].

If you want to obey dependency checking at build time for any reason,
you can use --skip-deps option.
