two versions are allways in ChangeLog.

0.4
===

* Improves compatibility with more phone modules, by not requiring all
  functions to be implemented/supported. For now reading of all stuff should
  work with all phones Gammu supports.
* Now doesn't require wxPython 2.4.2.4, but 2.4.1.2, which should be in all
  recent distributions.
* Will work even if you didn't have Gammu configured before.

0.3
===

* First widely announced release.
